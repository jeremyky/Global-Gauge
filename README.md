Global Gauge is an interactive web-based visualization that reveals the world's energy and resource usage in an intuitive and engaging way.
It features a 3D draggable globe displaying country-level and sector-level statistics, with clean borders and real-time hover tooltips.
The goal is to make global resource consumptino more understandable and actionable for the public, researchers, and policymakers.
Users can explore energy footprints by country, see how emerging technologies contribute to global demand, and gain insights into the world's environmental impact all in one elegant, interactive interface.

This is part of my Public Interest Technology project for the build4good Navigators program organized by New America.
